# About Me

Hello, I'm Lian Yijiang. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University and was the former Chief Architect of Baidu's Phoenix Nest.

I have a passion for AI and mathematics. In my free time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar.

Here, you will find some of my thoughts on technology and life.

Thank you for your visiting!
